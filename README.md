# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT :

The files are uploaded on GITHUB - https://github.com/Keshavvats9470/Movies-Search  

You can download the zip file through the github website itself or can take a pull from github desktop as the folder is public.

After taking the pull or downloading the file - 
Open Terminal - Either the IDE or System.
Go to the root folder of the project
npm install - This will install the node modules folder which contains the packages.
npm run - This will run the project on the user's local system.

# Website Link Hosted on Vercel also
https://movie-info-wolkus-project.vercel.app/

### ** Note → The hosted link provided will not be able to fetch the details of movies related to OMDB API. OMDB API - provides NON-SSL (HTTP) request but Vercel provides (HTTPS) , so VERCEL will not allow the unsecured API’s to allow the functionalities and restricts them. **So to see if the API is working, Kindly run it on a local device.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
