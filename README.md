# ** Note → The hosted link provided will not be able to fetch the details of movies related to OMDB API. OMDB API - provides NON-SSL (HTTP) request but Vercel provides (HTTPS) , so VERCEL will not allow the unsecured API’s to allow the functionalities and restricts them. **So to see if the API is working, Kindly run it on a local device.
